This git project contains several preconfigured PHP environments as base for different kind of projects.

Each flavour should get an own branch, prefixed by the name of the inherited image and suffixed with the special purpose.

e.G. `php-7.0-alpine-smyfony` where `php-7.0-alpine` ist the name of the used image and `symfony` means that this image should be used for symfony projects.
